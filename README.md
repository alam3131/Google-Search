# Google-Search
My own recreation of Google Search, Google Image Search and Google's Advanced Search using HTML and CSS. These searches are capable of performing the same actions that Google's own searches perform.

 ### Directions to Launch the HTML Page
 Make sure to have the zip file downloaded and then you should unzip the zip file. From within the folder, find either the index.html, images.html or advancedSearch.html files and open one of them by double clicking on them. This should open the HTML page. The buttons on the top right of the pages are links that leads to the other HTML pages.
